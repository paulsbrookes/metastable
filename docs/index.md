## About

This documentation accompanies the research paper ["A Real-time Instanton Approach to Quantum Activation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00681) (arXiv:2409.00681) by Chang-Woo Lee, Paul Brookes, Kee-Su Park, Marzena H. Szyma≈Ñska, and Eran Ginossar.

This work covers research into quantum activation in driven dissipative systems far from equilibrium. The paper and this documentation focus on understanding how quantum noise associated with relaxation can lead to transitions between metastable states, even at zero temperature.

Key areas of investigation include:
- Analysis of fixed points in the bistable regime
- Comparison of different transition mechanisms (thermal activation, quantum tunneling, quantum activation)
- Development of Keldysh field theory approach
- Study of quantum fluctuations and their role in state transitions

The documentation is automatically synchronized with interactive Jupyter notebooks for each section, allowing for both theoretical study and computational exploration of the concepts.
