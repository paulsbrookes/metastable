    <h1>Switching Dynamics in a Driven Nonlinear Oscillator</h1>

<p>Here we study the switching dynamics of a driven nonlinear oscillator at zero temperature in the bistable regime. Switching refers to the process by which the system transitions from one metastable state to another, and below we will review three methods by which this may occur, before placing our focu on quantum activation. We will study this approach in more depth using an instanton approach based on Keldysh field theory [1].</p>

<h2>Fixed Points in the Bistable Regime</h2>

<p>In the bistable regime, the classical equations of motion exhibit three fixed points: an unstable saddle point and two stable nodes. The nodes are surrounded by basins of attraction, and the saddle point lies on the line in phase space which divides them, known as the separatrix.</p>

<h2>Transition Mechanisms Between Nodes</h2>

<p>Let's review three methods by which the system may transition from one node to another:</p>

<h3>1. Thermal Activation</h3>

<p>In systems at finite temperature, thermal fluctuations from an external bath can provide the energy needed to overcome the potential barrier separating the two stable states. The transition rate follows Kramers' law, with an exponential dependence on the ratio of the barrier height to the thermal energy (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mi>T</mi></mrow></math>) according to the Boltzmann distribution [2]. This mechanism dominates at high temperatures, but here we will only consider the zero temperature case where this process vanishes.</p>

<h3>2. Quantum Tunneling</h3>

<p>At very low temperatures, quantum tunneling through the potential barrier may occur. While this process exists even at zero temperature, it becomes exponentially suppressed as the barrier height or width increases [3]. The tunneling rate takes the form <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>exp</mi><mo stretchy="false">&#x00028;</mo><mo>&#x02212;</mo><mn>2</mn><msub><mi>S</mi><mrow><mtext>tun</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>&#x0002F;</mo><mi>&#x003BB;</mi><mo stretchy="false">&#x00029;</mo></mrow></math>, where <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>S</mi><mrow><mtext>tun</mtext></mrow></msub></mrow></math> is the tunneling action. TO-DO: WHAT IS LAMBDA HERE</p>

<h3>3. Quantum Activation</h3>

<p>In driven dissipative systems far from equilibrium, a distinct mechanism called quantum activation becomes dominant [4, 5]. This process arises from the quantum noise that accompanies relaxation due to coupling with a thermal bath. Unlike tunneling, quantum activation involves transitions over the effective barrier through these quantum fluctuations, even at zero temperature [6, 7]. The switching rate takes the form <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mrow><mtext>sw</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>&#x0221D;</mo><mi>exp</mi><mo stretchy="false">&#x00028;</mo><mo>&#x02212;</mo><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo>&#x0002F;</mo><mi>&#x003BB;</mi><mo stretchy="false">&#x00029;</mo></mrow></math>, where <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>A</mi></msub></mrow></math> is the effective activation energy and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>&#x003BB;</mi></mrow></math> is the effective Planck constant in the rotating frame. This process has no analog in equilibrium systems and yields exponentially larger switching rates compared to tunneling, making it the dominant switching mechanism unless the relaxation rate is exponentially small.</p>

<h2>Instanton Approach to Quantum Activation</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Our task to find the rate at which the system transitions from one metastable state to another. Broadly this involves picking an initial state, evolving it over some time period, and finding the probability with which it has reached the target final state. Whereas a closed system could be described by a pure quantum state, and would evolve under the action of a unitary time evolution operator, our system is coupled to its environment and experiences significant drive and dissipation. Therefore it should be studied under the action of more general Liouvillian superoperator.</p>

<p>Finding transition rates can then be done in multiple ways. For example, one could write a Lindblad master equation for the system and evolve it numerically, or switching events could be simulated using a stochastic Schroedinger equation, but here we use the Keldysh path integral formalism. This approach is particularly powerful for our non-equilibrium system as it naturally incorporates both quantum effects and dissipation, while allowing us to identify the most probable switching paths through instanton solutions.</p>

<p>In this context, an instanton is the path of least action solution to the equations of motion in the Keldysh field theory formalism that connects the two stable nodes (metastable states) through the saddle point. This trajectory represents the most probable path by which the system surmounts the effective barrier via quantum fluctuations—even at zero temperature—due to the intrinsic non-equilibrium noise accompanying dissipation. The action of this instanton forms the exponential factor in the switching rate and therefore dominates its dependence on system parameters.</p>

<h3>Method</h3>

<p>To calculate the instanton solutions and their associated switching rates, we follow these steps:</p>

<li><p><strong>Set up the Keldysh Framework</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Express the system's action using classical and quantum fields</li>

<ul>
<li>Three points in bistable regime</li>
<li>Single point in monostable regime</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Analyze stability via linearization and Jacobian eigenvalues</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Initial node position and outgoing Jacobian eigenvectors</li>
<li>Saddle point position and incoming Jacobian eigenvectors</li>
</ul></li>
