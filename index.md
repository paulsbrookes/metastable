# Metastable States in Driven Nonlinear Systems

This repository contains research and documentation on the study of switching dynamics in driven nonlinear oscillators, with a particular focus on quantum activation in the bistable regime at zero temperature.

## Core Concepts

1. [Overview](explain/Overview.md) - Introduction to switching dynamics and transition mechanisms

## About

This documentation covers research into quantum activation in driven dissipative systems far from equilibrium. The work focuses on understanding how quantum noise associated with relaxation can lead to transitions between metastable states, even at zero temperature.

Key areas of investigation include:
- Analysis of fixed points in the bistable regime
- Comparison of different transition mechanisms (thermal activation, quantum tunneling, quantum activation)
- Development of Keldysh field theory approach
- Study of quantum fluctuations and their role in state transitions

The documentation is automatically synchronized with interactive Jupyter notebooks for each section, allowing for both theoretical study and computational exploration of the concepts.
