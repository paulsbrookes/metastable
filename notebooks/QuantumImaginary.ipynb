        "  These fields are introduced as auxiliary variables in formulations like the Martin\u2013Siggia\u2013Rose or Keldysh techniques. Their role is to enforce the equations of motion, incorporate fluctuations, and ensure proper causality in the theory. To achieve these aims, the response fields are often rotated into the imaginary axis (or equivalently, are defined as purely imaginary).</p>",

        "  In the path-integral formulation, the integration over the classical (physical) fields is performed along the real axis. If the response fields were also real, the resulting action might lead to oscillatory integrals that are hard to control. By rotating the integration contour for $\\tilde{x}_q$ and $\\tilde{p}_q$ into the imaginary direction (or by defining them as purely imaginary), one can improve the convergence properties of the path integral.</p>",

        "  The response fields play a key role in enforcing causality (e.g., ensuring that the response to a perturbation vanishes for times before the perturbation). The imaginary nature of these fields is often linked to the requirement that the response functions have the correct analytic properties, which is essential in many nonequilibrium and dissipative systems.</p>",
